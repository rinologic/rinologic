- 👋 Hi, I’m @rinologic
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack web application development using TypeScript/JavaScript frameworks such as Angular. I am interested in linguistics, language learning and using software to assist with language learning. My favorite language is Korean. My most proficient language is Japanese.
- 🌱 I am currently learning the TTSMaker API https://pro.ttsmaker.com/api-platform/api-docs-v2 to assist with a Korean audio learning application called Kactus.
